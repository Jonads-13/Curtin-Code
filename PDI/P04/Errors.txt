error is that after they ask the user for the "searchInt" value, they don't use it again so the array program won't know what the user wants to search for.

another error is that there is no else statement in the if statement

redundency is the double delcaring of found as true wihout there being another option for found to be false anywhere.

an efficiency is the layout of the algorithim. indents used inconsistently and variables not declared all at once.
